Overview
--------

* **Freedom to build what you want**  RES-CAD is an extension to the FreeCAD open-source parametric 3D modeler made primarily to design real-life objects of any size. Parametric modeling allows you to easily modify your design by going back into your model history to change its parameters. 

* **Create 3D from 2D and back** RES-CAD lets you to sketch geometry constrained 2D shapes and use them as a base to build other objects. It contains many components to adjust dimensions or extract design details from 3D models to create high quality production-ready drawings.

* **Designed for your needs** RES-CAD is designed to fit a wide range of uses including product design, mechanical engineering and architecture, whether you are a hobbyist, programmer, experienced CAD user, student or teacher.

* **Cross platform** RES-CAD runs on Windows, macOS and Linux operating systems.

* **Underlying technology**
    * **OpenCASCADE** A powerful geometry kernel, the most important component of RES-CAD
    * **Coin3D library** Open Inventor-compliant 3D scene representation model
    * **Python** RES-CAD offers a broad Python API
    * **Qt** Graphical user interface built with Qt
